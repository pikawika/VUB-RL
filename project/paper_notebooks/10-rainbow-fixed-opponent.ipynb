    "In the previous notebook, `9-rainbow.ipynb`, we created a CNN based Rainbow agent and found the results to be quite good.\n",
    "However, agent 2 was significantly worse in human play than agent 1.\n",
    "As an attempt to resolve this, we let the rainbow agents train further by playing against a frozen opponent, forming somewhat of a \"league based\" training cycle.\n",
    "This is based on the approach used in `7-cnn-dqn-fixed-opponent.ipynb` and `8-mlp-dqn-fixed-opponent.ipynb`."
