    "# Using RLlib for more multi-agent learning control\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in `5-improving-dqn-architecture.ipynb` we thought of three aspects that might be the root of the agent's not learning to play the game pleasingly:\n",
    "- Training two DQN agents simultaneously is known to be though, especially when starting from a random initialisation\n",
    "- The network used was a simple MLP\n",
    "- The training is not done over enough iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebooks `5-improving-dqn-architecture.ipynb` and `6-dqn-using-a-cnn.ipynb`, two alternative networks besides MLP were used.\n",
    "Whilst these give somewhat satisfactory results when trained for long enough and incentivising moves by giving a reward for making a move, it is still far from perfect.\n",
    "The iterations were also boosted to a couple of hours on a CUDA GPU, which didn't improve things all that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, what is most likely to be an issue is the fact that we are training two agents simultaneously.\n",
    "This makes it hard to get a good performing agent.\n",
    "An alternative to this is training an agent for a couple of epochs whilst freezing the other and alternating this between the agents.\n",
    "This makes the problem to learn \"stationary\" in a certain way and is known to make learning easier.\n",
    "What is also done, often in very complex games, is starting from a somewhat smart agent instead of a random one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will use [Ray RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html), which is better documented for use in multi-agent environments and PettingZoo like environments in particular.\n",
    "They also note that zero-sum environments are harder to learn in multi-agent settings.\n",
    "That is why we introduce a reward for making moves and a high reward for playing a tie game.\n",
    "We hope to create agents that are capable of reaching a tie board or extending losses maximally in this manner."
