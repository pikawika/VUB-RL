    "## Training DQN vs Random agent on connect four Gym\n",
    "\n",
    "Our connect four gym setup requires two agents, one for each player.\n",
    "To reduce complexity, agents will always play as the same player, e.g. always as player 1.\n",
    "It is important to note that connect four is a *solved game*.\n",
    "According to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/08/how-to-win-any-popular-game-according-to-data-scientists/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Connect Four is what mathematicians call a \"solved game,\" meaning you can play it perfectly every time, no matter what your opponent does. You will need to get the first move, but as long as you do so, you can always win within 41 moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the Gym environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst our first connect four implementation (V1) was playable in a multi-agent manner through a manual game loop, as is done for random agents in the experimental notebook `2-testing-custom-gym-environment.ipynb`, it is hard to use most of the popular RL libraries for this environment.\n",
    "That is because the Gym environment was originally made with single agent games in mind and there is no real standard on how to write multi-agent environments.\n",
    "Thus, Tianshou, which offers some multi-agent support, didn't work well with this version of the Gym environment.\n",
    "To tackle this, we created a V2, which is a rework of V1 to follow the standards of a *Petting Zoo* environment.\n",
    "[Petting zoo](https://www.pettingzoo.ml/) is a library that offers many Gym environments extended to be multi-agent which uses wrapper classes and base classes so that each multi-agent environment follows the same guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines are exactly what V2 of our connect four implementation is adopted towards.\n",
    "The environment is now a subclass of `AECEnv` rather than a `gym.Env`, which follows a similar approach but requires far more attributes and more complex observation and action spaces so that each agent has its own, even if they are all equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that we only found out about this library after running into trouble making our V1 work with libraries that support Gym training.\n",
    "We could have searched for online implementations of e.g. Deep Q-Network (DQN) that allows training using the gym gaming loop used in the experimental notebook `2-testing-custom-gym-environment.ipynb`. \n",
    "Nonetheless, this would likely require a lot of manual work which is not ideal for the goal of this research, which focuses on reducing work for game developers.\n",
    "Thus, the decision was made to create this V2 of the environment based on Petting Zoo environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, we noticed there was a Connect Four implementation of Petting Zoo.\n",
    "This implementation differs from ours in several ways.\n",
    "Their observation space consists of multiple variants of the board, namely one with only the opponent's coin and the agent's coins and it uses action masks to not allow placing coins in full columns.\n",
    "We use a singular observation space of the complete board, which is the location of both agent's coins and the free spaces, corresponding to what a human would see.\n",
    "Adding to this, we also don't programmatically disallow placing a coin in a full column but rather punish the user for trying that action and leave the board unchanged and let the agent play again.\n",
    "There are more differences then the ones listed here and the visual game is also completely different."
