    "# Improving DQN architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous two notebooks, `3-learning-connect-four-dqn-agents-tianshou.ipynb` and `4-improving-dqn-agents.ipynb`, have shown that there is an improvement to be made to make the agents truly interesting.\n",
    "The issue probably lies in a combination of at least three things:\n",
    "- Training two DQN agents simultaneously is known to be though, especially when starting from a random initialisation\n",
    "- The network used was a simple MLP\n",
    "- The training is not done over enough iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to the first issue would be to fix one agent's policy for several episodes whilst training the other and switching back and forth between the agents.\n",
    "Instead of an MLP, a CNN based approach could be used, which makes sense in this setting.\n",
    "Once somewhat promising results emerge, training time can be increased given it is still manageable on average consumer-grade hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will try to use a custom NN for training the DQN."

    "When not using a reward for taking moves, the policy still mainly converges to stacking coins.\n",

    "Whilst the policy is thus the best so far when using a reward for making moves, it is still far from ideal. We will have to look further if we want to create a trully meaningful bot for connect four. We also wonder if the learned policy is a reaction on the observed board or a replay from memory of what worked. This is the difference between a connect four bot working against any component vs a specific one. To test this, the next notebook will focus on creating a loop in such a way that we can play against a bot."
