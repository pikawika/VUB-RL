    "# CNN based DQN agent against fixed opponent\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in `5-improving-dqn-architecture.ipynb` we thought of three aspects that might be the root of the agent's not learning to play the game pleasingly:\n",
    "- Training two DQN agents simultaneously is known to be though, especially when starting from a random initialisation\n",
    "- The network used was a simple MLP\n",
    "- The training is not done over enough iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebooks `5-improving-dqn-architecture.ipynb` and `6-dqn-using-a-cnn.ipynb`, two alternative networks besides MLP were used.\n",
    "Whilst these give somewhat satisfactory results when trained for long enough and incentivising moves by giving a reward for making a move, it is still far from perfect.\n",
    "The iterations were also boosted to a couple of hours on a CUDA GPU, which didn't improve things all that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, what is most likely to be an issue is the fact that we are training two agents simultaneously.\n",
    "This makes it hard to get a good performing agent and makes the target non stationary as both agents evolve over time.\n",
    "An alternative to this is training an agent for a couple of epochs whilst freezing the other and alternating this between the agents.\n",
    "This makes the problem to learn more stationary and is known to make learning easier.\n",
    "What is also done, often in very complex games, is starting from a somewhat smart agent instead of a random one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst some libraries such as Ray RL lib offer implementations of such a training strategy, the experimental notebook `4-rllib-for-more-learning-control.ipynb` found that even the Ray provided example results in error codes.\n",
    "Seeing their GitHub page has many open issues, the one we encountered being one of them, we refrain from using a different library considering Tianshou has many algorithms implemented and we have found a way to make things work."
