# Reinforcement Learning @ VUB 2021 - 2022

This repository includes the exercises and final project of Lennert Bontinck for the Reinforcement Learning (RL) course @ VUB 2021 - 2022. The installation instructions, source code, extra documents and more can be found here.

The PDF report of the project can be found [here](paper/Lennert_Bontinck_RL_project.pdf), the source code of this LaTeX document is [also available](paper/source).

## Homework

The RL course has 3 different homework assignments, of which 2 were obligatory to be handed in. Since our project resolves around OpenAI Gym, it was opted to drop this assignment and do the other two assignments as deliverable for the obligatory part of the homework.

The solutions for these homework assignments can be found here:

| **Name**                                               | **More information**                        |

## Project

The main purpose of the RL course is to become familiar with different RL techniques and be capable of making an RL project yourselves. For this, the final deliverable is a project that consists of a proposal.
